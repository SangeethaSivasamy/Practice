Design URL Shortner (Bitly company does this operation, disign object model for Bitly company. 
it takes long URL and give a corresponding short url).


1- How many URLs it will support
2-Length of Long URLs it will support
3-Length of short URLs it will support
4-Response Time/Latency
5-How many days URL will be in the database (answer is basically url will be there in the database but after a
  particular days the url will be inactive).
6-security
7-Monitoring system
8-uptime of the application(four 9-->99.99%(good application), five 9(99.999%)-->means application is very good 
  like google, three 9(99.9%)-->application has lots of issues) 
9-Disaster recovery  
  
  
  
 database design------->>>>>>>>>
 
 1- database shading
 use databse concept called shading(take the example of shading-->we have a to z(26 character), 0 to 9(10 digit))
 total 36, so if the url first chaacter is a to j, send it to first database, like wise k to t, send it to
 another database, like this, we can take many databse and store data.
 
 2- master slave application(we can design in such a way that, for example one master and 20 slave
   , when we are creating something, we will create it in master and it will sync to all it's slave
    and all the get operation will heat only the slaves(not the master)), if master goes down, one of the slave
    will take over and work as a master. this master-slave concept,by using this concept, we are scaling 
    read operation,similarly we have master-master concept as well which scale post/put/ operation(here we will have
    more than 1 masters), here in master-master concept, we will write only in one master and after that
    it will sync to other masters as well. 
  
  OverAll project structure------->>>>>>>> 
    API-->Backend--->Database
    
    Use hashing(MD5) for converting long URL to short
