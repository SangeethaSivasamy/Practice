There are n no of servers, we need to collect logs and put it in a centralised system and if there is any error
then alert some team.


1- How often, we need to collect logs and what will be the size of logs.
2- end to end latency (when the logs is available in the centralised system and the time when it is ready
   to be quired).
3-Time to Live(TTL) of the logs


ELK---> Elastic search(based on solar(for the below para descriptions,
        Elastic search is Receiver+storage+Indexer)),
        log stash(work as the agent/process who gathers the logs
        from the servers and it sits in the server, plz read the below paragraph) , 
        Kibana(mostly used for presenting)


1---->>>>  There are n servers available, there would be n agents/process sitting in all the servers which will gather 
logs from these n servers, process it and send it to a receiver, once receiver receives all the data, it will
send the data to a storage and storage send it to Indexer which will index it so, that it will be ready/easy
for quired. At last the presenter will present the data.
