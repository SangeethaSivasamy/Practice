/**
 *1. If currentNode is null, return height as 0. This indicates that a null tree is balanced with height of 0. This would be the base case for this algorithm.
2. We check if left sub-tree is balanced by making a recursive call:  leftSubtreeHeight = checkBalance(currentNode.left)
If left sub-tree is not balanced, we return -1 to indicate that the tree rooted at currentNode is unbalanced as well.
3. We check if right sub-tree is balanced by making a recursive call:  rightSubtreeHeight = checkBalance(currentNode.right)
If right sub-tree is not balanced, we return -1 to indicate that the tree rooted at currentNode is unbalanced as well.
4. If both left and right sub-trees are balanced, we check the balance of the tree at the currentNode by checking absolute difference of leftSubtreeHeight and rightSubtreeHeight. 
If it is greater than 1, then we return -1 to indicate imbalance.
5. If the tree is balanced at the currentNode as well, then we return height of the tree at the currentNode by returning (Math.max(leftSubtreeHeight, rightSubtreeHeight) + 1).
