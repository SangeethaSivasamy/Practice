In the morning hours of a day in 1889, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson awake to discover that a visitor had
been to their apartment the previous night but departed before seeing either man. However, he left behind a
walking stick. The walking stick bears the inscription: “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the
C.C.H.” This allows the two to begin making some deductions about his character and occupation using
Holmes’s methods (basically picking out details of an object and making likely inferences from it). Watson
describes a likeable old country doctor who received the stick from a local hunt, a theory that Holmes has
several objections to. He argues instead for the case of a young practitioner presented with the stick when he
left London’s Charing Cross Hospital (C.C.H.) to move to the country. Watson checks on some of the details
and, with the appearance of the curly-haired spaniel whose teeth marks are imprinted on the cane, followed
shortly by his owner, James Mortimer, the rest of the deductions are able to be investigated. As it turns out,
Holmes is only slightly off, as Mortimer had been given the cane when he was married (which the detective had
not guessed), and that in turn had brought about the departure from the city. Dr. Mortimer is tall, though his
frame is hunched over. He wears glasses and appropriate dress, if somewhat shabby. Though a man with
scientific leanings (an M.R.C.S. is a member of the Royal College of Surgeons), he is also vulnerable to
superstitions. He admits himself to be “an unpractical man” and so has come to get advice on his problem.
Though Holmes feels slightly offended at Mortimer’s ranking of him as secondary in “precisely scientific”
matters to Monsieur Bertillon, he asks him to expand on the trouble that has brought him there.
